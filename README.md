# Week-1-Homework

## Overview
For this project we were tasked to create a repository in Github and be able to push our file directory from our main source to that repositiory. The files to be uploaded included a README. MD, Liscense.txt, assets, and Index html. We were also tasked to correct any broken links in the Index.html, and reformat the the code to have correct syntax.
