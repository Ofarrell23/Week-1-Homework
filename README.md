## Overview
For this project, we were tasked to create a repository in Github and be able to push our file directory from our main source to that repository. The files to be uploaded included a README. MD, Liscense.txt, assets, and Index HTML. We were also tasked to correct any broken links in the provided HTML, and reformat the code to have the correct syntax. My motivation for this project was to strengthen my Github experience by better familiarize myself with using the terminal to add, commit, and push data to Github. In addition to the Github experience, I also gained better knowledge of how code and information should be displayed on a HTML and CSS pages.

## Installation

1. Create a Github account
2. Within Github.com create a new Repository.
3. Once your new repository is created make a name for your repository and click the public button, and initializ this repository with README
